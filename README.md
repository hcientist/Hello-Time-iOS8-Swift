Hello-Time-iOS8-Swift
=====================

Ported the Hello Time example from [iOS 7 in Action](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/mobile/9781617291425) to Swift and iOS 8

Special thanks to [matt on stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/341994/matt) for his [delay function](http://stackoverflow.com/a/24318861/1449799) since `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:` isn't around in Swift.
